## 🚀 1. **Build and Start the Range**

```bash
docker compose up --build
````

* `--build` ensures the latest Dockerfiles are built.
* The first build may take several minutes (especially the client desktop image).

---

## 🔄 2. **Restarting the Range Quickly**

After the initial build, you can restart without rebuilding:

```bash
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

This will use the cached images, starting the environment in seconds.

---
## 🌐 3. **Accessing the Client Desktop**

### noVNC (Browser-based)

* After starting the containers, check the logs for the URL:

  ```
  http://<host-ip>:6901/?password=<auto-generated>
  ```

  On a local machine, use:
  ```
  http://localhost:6901
  ```

* The VNC password is either:

  * Printed in the logs (`?password=...`), or
  * `vncpassword` if you set `VNC_PW` in `docker-compose.yml`.


* Connect to:

  ```
  localhost:5901
  ```

  with the same password.

---
* The client routes all traffic through the proxy (`10.200.0.3`).

---

* The client and proxy each write timestamped `.pcap` files on startup.
Example:

```
```

---

## 📁 6. **Getting Files Out of the Client**

* Any file saved to `/captures` inside the client appears in `./captures` on the host.
* You can also use `docker cp`:

  ```bash
  docker cp network_emulation-client-1:/path/to/file ./file

---

## 🧹 7. **Cleaning Up**

To remove all containers, networks, and volumes:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

To rebuild from scratch (including images):

```bash
docker compose down -v --rmi all
```
---

## ✅ 8. **Quick Commands Cheat Sheet**

* **Start and build:**

  ```bash
  docker compose up --build
  ```

* **Stop:**

  ```bash
  docker compose down
  ```

* **Check logs:**

  ```bash
  docker compose logs client
  docker compose logs proxy

* **Copy files:**

  ```bash
  docker cp network_emulation-client-1:/captures ./captures_backup
  ```


## 🔐 9. **Setting a Custom VNC Password**

In `docker-compose.yml`, under the client service:

```yaml
environment:
  - VNC_PW=password
```

Rebuild:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```


Would you also like me to include an **ASCII network diagram** showing `client → proxy → internet` inside this guide for clarity?
